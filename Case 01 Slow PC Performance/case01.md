# Case 01: Slow PC Performanc

## Issue Description
The user notices that the workstation runs slowly when launching applications or opening multiple browser tabs.

## Root Cause
Excessive startup applications and high background CPU usage are impacting overall system performance.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Open **Task Manager** and navigate to the **Performance** tab to get an overview of CPU, Memory, and Disk usage.  
2. Identify processes that are consuming high **CPU** or **Memory resources**.  
3. Switch to the **Startup** tab and **disable non-essential applications** to reduce load at boot.  
4. Run **Disk Cleanup** to remove temporary files and free up storage space.  
5. Restart the PC and monitor performance to confirm improvements.
