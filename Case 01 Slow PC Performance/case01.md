# Case 01: Slow PC Performance

## Issue Description
User reported the workstation was running slowly when launching applications and opening multiple browser tabs.

## Root Cause
Excessive startup applications and elevated background CPU utilization impacting overall system performance.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Opened **Task Manager** and reviewed the **Performance tab**.  
2. Identified processes with high **CPU** and **Memory usage**.  
3. Disabled non-essential applications in the **Startup tab**.  
4. Ran **Disk Cleanup** to remove temporary files and free up storage.  
5. Restarted the PC and validated performance improvements.
